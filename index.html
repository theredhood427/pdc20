                    <h1>Why is HTML5 important?</h1>
                    <h4>from:<a href="https://www.gomolearning.com/blog/elearning-technology/what-is-html5-why-is-it-important/#:~:text=The%20technology%20market%20being%20saturated,now%20predominantly%20performed%20on%20mobile.">Gomo Learning</a></h4>

            <p>So with all that background out of the way, what are the real benefits of HTML5 for everyday users? Within the context of modern technology and user behavior,
                HTML5 has provided several huge advancements for the Internet.
                First of all, we’re now able to natively stream video and audio files in a web browser without plugins.
                That means no more risky downloads just to access content, and for anyone who watches video online (and that’s pretty much everyone!) this is a big deal. 
                Furthermore, without the need for third-party software, your connection speeds will be quicker and your laptop or mobile battery lasts longer!
                It’s a win-win.
                
                Secondly, HTML5 has been specifically developed with mobile use in mind. The technology 
                market being saturated with smart devices with different screen sizes and resolutions, HTML5 allows users to have a consistent web experience across multiple devices. 
                This has become increasingly vital since Google confirmed that global search traffic is now predominantly performed on mobile. No more pinch-and-zoom for pesky non-responsive 
                websites and a better User Experience (UX) for all.</p>
